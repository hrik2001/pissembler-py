# Pissembler-py
This project started mostly as a scratchpad to validate logic for an assembler that I am writing in rust. But rather it became big and clean enough
(I can't emphasize how much the latter part matters), to become a full fledged project

**Note**: Things are still rough, feel free to contribute :)
